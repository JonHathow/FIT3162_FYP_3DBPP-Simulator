    # Data Flow Testing: This test verifies that data flows correctly between different modules or components, making it an integration test focused on data integration.

    # Interface Testing: Testing the interfaces between different components to ensure they communicate effectively is a classic form of integration testing.

    # Database Integration Testing: This type of testing focuses on verifying that data is properly stored, retrieved, and updated in the database when different components interact with it, making it an integration test.

    # Security Integration Testing: Ensuring that security measures are correctly implemented at integration points is a form of integration testing that checks how different components interact with security features.

    # Dependency Testing: This type of testing checks that all dependencies are correctly integrated, which is a key aspect of integration testing.

    # End-to-End Testing: While primarily focused on verifying the entire system's functionality, end-to-end tests also involve the integration of different components, making them a type of integration test.
